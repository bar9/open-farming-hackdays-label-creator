Architecture
* Country lists are duplicated and inconsistent: Single component with CH, EU, Keine Herkunftsangabe nötig, ALL ISO countries
* is_meat, is_fish, is_beef etc: things derived from categories should be handled in a centralised service
* debug output for rules in console

UI
* multiple validation errors: stack them instead of just showing one
* umstellung additional texts should be just print text (black on white, no borders or anything, just to the left of the logo)
